# Project Overview

In this project I am given [a web-based application that reads RSS feeds](http://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader). The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! My job is to complete the test suite.

## How this works
Download the files or open this [online version](). Scroll down the page and you should see a Jasmine section. There are total 8 specs, 0 failures, meaning the application passes all tests. 

## Why this project

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.


## What I learn

* How to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application.
* Analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript application. 
* Understanding the logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

## View the test code

The test code is inside the jasmine > spec folder, `feedreader.js` is the file you would want to look at.
